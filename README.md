# Client Tracker

Client Tracker is an app for intake specialists at mental health clinics. They can see all clients who havenâ€™t been through intake. When they meet with one of the clients, they can take notes and write down possible disorders for therapists, as well as assign the client to a therapist.

There is also a therapist view, where they can see a list of their assigned clients and schedule sessions with them. They also have a calendar with future sessions where they can edit dates and times.
